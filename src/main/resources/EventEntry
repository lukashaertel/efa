Everything is bright and colorful! ... or is it? This year, one of the major TV networks is going to host an all new gameshow which will get the highest ratings yet! It is all about the ratings, isn't it? Join in as studio audience for our production of THE GAMESHOW!\r\n\r\nAs usual, the competition is between teams of two, so if you are a suiter willing to participate, be sure to pair up and be ready! If you can't find a partner, drop by anyway, we'll keep a list of single participants to mix and match!\r\n\r\n\"How are the teams selected?\", and \"Can I participate?\" - Sure! That's what the preliminaries are for! We have taken your feedback into consideration and split the preliminaries into several smaller games again, yet they will be located close to each other and in public view, in the Rotunda! There are some mini-games to judge dexterity and acting capabilities. Also, you can add bonus points by collecting for charity for ten minutes. Overall you should be done in about 10-15 minutes, without the 10 minute charity run. The results - and thus the players for the stage show - will be on display next to the fursuit lounge entrance at about 19:00 (7pm) give or take.\r\n\r\nIf you participate in the preliminaries, be prepared to be on stage for the main event too! We need eight teams (and a spare one) to go on stage after all! Also, if you are amongst the first ten teams, be sure to be at the stage briefing ON TIME as we need to assign the available game combinations to the teams and explain the games you are going to play! You need to attend both, the briefing and the stage event for the full duration: 14:30-17:30 so please don't sign up if you can't make the time! Stage briefing can be attended without fursuit though.\r\n\r\nEarly Sign up for the preliminaries is on Wednesday, 18:30-19:30. This is also the best opportunity to ask us questions! Regular sign up is on Thursday, 12:00-14:30. Both will be at the main registration desk!\r\n\r\nThe sign in station is also the place to get any questions answered that you still might have: just drop by early and ask us, we don't bite!\r\n\r\nKeep in mind, that you have to run, jump, grab- and throw things in suit. So be aware that even though we try to make these games safe for everyone, your suit has to take some physical action.\r\n\r\nSign up:\r\nEarly: Wednesday, 18:30-19:30, Main registration desk Regular: Thursday, 12:00-14:30, Main registration desk\r\n\r\nPreliminaries:\r\nThursday, 12:30-15:00, Rotunda\r\n\r\nStage Briefing, for the qualified teams:\r\nFriday, 14:30-15:30, Main Stage\r\n\r\nThe Fursuit Gameshow:\r\nFriday, 16:00-17:30, Main Stage","ConferenceDayId":"8af3def1-2b00-11e6-af7b-066e23d209cf","StartTime":"12:00:00","EndTime":"14:30:00","Duration":"02:30:00","ConferenceRoomId":"7e3dad60-fee6-4ab8-b1be-a99655ec4218","PanelHosts":"Atkelar","IsDeviatingFromConBook":"0"},{"Id":"135c768f-cf4c-41e0-8ea1-ed2560e89df2","LastChangeDateTimeUtc":"2016-08-11T17:40:01Z","IsDeleted":"0","SourceEventId":"1001","ImageId":null,"Slug":"photographers_round_table","Title":"Photographers' Round Table","SubTitle":"","ConferenceTrackId":"735738c1-76c2-476a-830c-64df716f7982","Abstract":"Come in and join some fellow photographers in discussions about equipment, lighting, framing and image composition.\r\nFeel free to bring along some examples of your work and don't forget your camera.

Maybe you've been to the Motorfurs meet at the BAY WATCH all the cars and GOLDEN GIRLS. You might be bouncing all about with the GUMMIBEARS, listen to the cockroaches DUCKTALES, or chat with CHIP & CHAP. You may even have a bad hangover from saying too much CHEERS with MAGNUM-bottles and those FRAGGLES at the Bar.\r\nDon't despair, the Fursuit-Support A-TEAM has got you covered.

There's just one thing unfortunate: Having enough spaces on the powered drying rack for all 1000 fursuits will always be a MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. So please be so kind to remove your costume from the the powered dryer as soon as possible, to give another fur the chance to use it. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMain Lounge\r\nThe Main Lounge is located near the Main Stage, close to the dances and events. You can find all our services and plenty of space here. You should also gather here for the parade. This lounge will be locked a night.\r\n\r\nMini Lounge\r\nWith the size of the convention growing as it is, the Main Lounge may occasionally be a struggle to reach, if you are on the other end of the hotel and in need of a cup of water and a safe place. Therefore we now have the Mini Lounge in the Estrel Hall Foyer, near the lobby. (That is the room in front of the ConOps office). A smaller location with viewing protection and fresh water around the clock, for a quick heads-off cool down.\r\n \r\n \r\nBoth fursuit lounges are fursuiters-only areas, intended to offer a safe place to quickly cool down, get some refreshments, make repairs, dry their suits and change costumes without ruining the magic. To make the fursuiters' stay in the fursuit lounges as convenient as possible, please respect the following rules:\r\n\r\n- Only fursuiters may enter and stay in the fursuit lounge at any time, in and out of fursuit.\r\n- Non-Suiters are not allowed to enter the headless area.\r\n- The only exception are personal helpers, assisting a fursuiter with their costume. They can only enter the lounge hand-in-hand with the suiter for the time they are assisting, but not on their own.\r\n- Suiters currently not in suit will need to present their personal fursuit badge at the checkpoint to enter the lounge.\r\n- Please refrain from bringing glass cups\/bottles into the lounge, to protect suiters from broken glass.\r\n- Photography and filming is strictly forbidden.\r\n\r\nFursuit Lounge Opening Hours\r\n\r\nMain Lounge: 09:00 - 02:00 or end of dance\r\nMini Lounge: always open\r\n\r\nThe Main Lounge is open every convention day from 09:00 and closes 30 minutes after the last event. Should you need to access the lounge after this, you can contact EF-Security via the hotline and kindly ask them to let you in. The Mini Lounge near the lobby is open around the clock.\r\n\r\nExtra Days!\r\nOn Early Arrival Day, the lounge is open from 18:00 to 02:00 the next morning.\r\nOn Sunday after the convention, the lounge opens at 09:00.

For me, this is the most important part: finding the theme for my musical piece with the help of different (but mostly orchestral) styles and genres.\r\n \r\nWe will anaylize and go through some work of John Powell (\u201eHow to Train Your Dragon\u201c), Thomas Bergerson (Two Steps from Hell) and Gareth Coker (\u201eOri and the Blind Forest\u201c). \r\n \r\nIf there is enough time left, we will develop our own music theme and find ways to make variations of it.\r\n \r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MkzeOmkOUHM\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JNhA8qyykkk\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=izsjRpcgfmk&index=14&list=PL7_8KJvbYl3QZ9UWdyYA6ByWXsu0M9TjS\r\n","ConferenceDayId":"8af3f161-2b00-11e6-af7b-066e23d209cf","StartTime":"14:00:00","EndTime":"15:30:00","Duration":"01:30:00","ConferenceRoomId":"e13ecbed-9123-4c82-ae65-08316ee43037","PanelHosts":"CoVaHr","IsDeviatingFromConBook":"0"},{"Id":"371038e6-f618-437a-8d3f-0c8f1fe38062","LastChangeDateTimeUtc":"2016-07-15T17:20:01Z","IsDeleted":"0","SourceEventId":"1073","ImageId":null,"Slug":"fursuit_paw_photoshoot","Title":"Fursuit Paw Photoshooting","SubTitle":"","ConferenceTrackId":"4007871e-893b-45b1-87a8-9c15949279f0","Abstract":"Paw-related photoshooting.

Maybe you've been to the Motorfurs meet at the BAY WATCH all the cars and GOLDEN GIRLS. You might be bouncing all about with the GUMMIBEARS, listen to the cockroaches DUCKTALES, or chat with CHIP & CHAP. You may even have a bad hangover from saying too much CHEERS with MAGNUM-bottles and those FRAGGLES at the Bar.\r\nDon't despair, the Fursuit-Support A-TEAM has got you covered. When you feel lost in the past, we get you BACK TO THE FUTURE. Take the QUANTUM LEAP into one of our well equipped Fursuit Lounges and take your M.A.S.K. off.\r\nAs if MACGYVER and INSPECTOR GADGET designed them, they feature refreshments and mini snacks, cooling blowers and costume drying racks, repair station and coolpack freezer. There's just one thing unfortunate: Having enough spaces on the powered drying rack for all 1000 fursuits will always be a MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. So please be so kind to remove your costume from the the powered dryer as soon as possible, to give another fur the chance to use it. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMain Lounge\r\nThe Main Lounge is located near the Main Stage, close to the dances and events. You can find all our services and plenty of space here. You should also gather here for the parade. This lounge will be locked a night.\r\n\r\nMini Lounge\r\nWith the size of the convention growing as it is, the Main Lounge may occasionally be a struggle to reach, if you are on the other end of the hotel and in need of a cup of water and a safe place. Therefore we now have the Mini Lounge in the Estrel Hall Foyer, near the lobby. (That is the room in front of the ConOps office). A smaller location with viewing protection and fresh water around the clock, for a quick heads-off cool down.\r\n \r\n \r\nBoth fursuit lounges are fursuiters-only areas, intended to offer a safe place to quickly cool down, get some refreshments, make repairs, dry their suits and change costumes without ruining the magic. To make the fursuiters' stay in the fursuit lounges as convenient as possible, please respect the following rules:\r\n\r\n- Only fursuiters may enter and stay in the fursuit lounge at any time, in and out of fursuit.\r\n- Non-Suiters are not allowed to enter the headless area.\r\n- The only exception are personal helpers, assisting a fursuiter with their costume. They can only enter the lounge hand-in-hand with the suiter for the time they are assisting, but not on their own.\r\n- Suiters currently not in suit will need to present their personal fursuit badge at the checkpoint to enter the lounge.\r\n- Please refrain from bringing glass cups\/bottles into the lounge, to protect suiters from broken glass.\r\n- Photography and filming is strictly forbidden.\r\n\r\nFursuit Lounge Opening Hours\r\n\r\nMain Lounge: 09:00 - 02:00 or end of dance\r\nMini Lounge: always open\r\n\r\nThe Main Lounge is open every convention day from 09:00 and closes 30 minutes after the last event. Should you need to access the lounge after this, you can contact EF-Security via the hotline and kindly ask them to let you in. The Mini Lounge near the lobby is open around the clock.\r\n\r\nExtra Days!\r\nOn Early Arrival Day, the lounge is open from 18:00 to 02:00 the next morning.\r\nOn Sunday after the convention, the lounge opens at 09:00. At 14:00 breakdown of the lounges begins. Please remove all your fursuit parts from the dryer systems by this time.\r\nFor the Dead Dog Dance, the Main Lounge will operate with reduced equipment.","ConferenceDayId":"8af3d567-2b00-11e6-af7b-066e23d209cf","StartTime":"21:00:00","EndTime":"03:00:00","Duration":"06:00:00","ConferenceRoomId":"8d650ea7-f9b8-45b5-8a1c-7f8c519d362d","PanelHosts":"Mystifur","IsDeviatingFromConBook":"0"},{"Id":"3e70f7b1-250b-40d1-a4bb-172094db35c0","LastChangeDateTimeUtc":"2016-08-02T20:50:01Z","IsDeleted":"0","SourceEventId":"1058","ImageId":null,"Slug":"dead_dog_party","Title":"Dead Dog Party","SubTitle":"","ConferenceTrackId":"e64d4e82-eeb9-4e06-9c41-9fa15af748d0","Abstract":"Once more, another Eurofurence is over.

It is all about the ratings, isn't it? Join in as studio audience for our production of THE GAMESHOW!\r\n\r\nAs usual, the competition is between teams of two, so if you are a suiter willing to participate, be sure to pair up and be ready! If you can't find a partner, drop by anyway, we'll keep a list of single participants to mix and match!\r\n\r\n\"How are the teams selected?\", and \"Can I participate?\" - Sure! That's what the preliminaries are for! We have taken your feedback into consideration and split the preliminaries into several smaller games again, yet they will be located close to each other and in public view, in the Rotunda! There are some mini-games to judge dexterity and acting capabilities. Also, you can add bonus points by collecting for charity for ten minutes. Overall you should be done in about 10-15 minutes, without the 10 minute charity run. The results - and thus the players for the stage show - will be on display next to the fursuit lounge entrance at about 19:00 (7pm) give or take.\r\n\r\nIf you participate in the preliminaries, be prepared to be on stage for the main event too! We need eight teams (and a spare one) to go on stage after all! Also, if you are amongst the first ten teams, be sure to be at the stage briefing ON TIME as we need to assign the available game combinations to the teams and explain the games you are going to play! You need to attend both, the briefing and the stage event for the full duration: 14:30-17:30 so please don't sign up if you can't make the time! Stage briefing can be attended without fursuit though.\r\n\r\nEarly Sign up for the preliminaries is on Wednesday, 18:30-19:30. This is also the best opportunity to ask us questions!

You may even have a bad hangover from saying too much CHEERS with MAGNUM-bottles and those FRAGGLES at the Bar.\r\nDon't despair, the Fursuit-Support A-TEAM has got you covered. When you feel lost in the past, we get you BACK TO THE FUTURE. Take the QUANTUM LEAP into one of our well equipped Fursuit Lounges and take your M.A.S.K. off.\r\nAs if MACGYVER and INSPECTOR GADGET designed them, they feature refreshments and mini snacks, cooling blowers and costume drying racks, repair station and coolpack freezer. There's just one thing unfortunate: Having enough spaces on the powered drying rack for all 1000 fursuits will always be a MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. So please be so kind to remove your costume from the the powered dryer as soon as possible, to give another fur the chance to use it. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMain Lounge\r\nThe Main Lounge is located near the Main Stage, close to the dances and events. You can find all our services and plenty of space here. You should also gather here for the parade. This lounge will be locked a night.\r\n\r\nMini Lounge\r\nWith the size of the convention growing as it is, the Main Lounge may occasionally be a struggle to reach, if you are on the other end of the hotel and in need of a cup of water and a safe place. Therefore we now have the Mini Lounge in the Estrel Hall Foyer, near the lobby. (That is the room in front of the ConOps office). A smaller location with viewing protection and fresh water around the clock, for a quick heads-off cool down.\r\n \r\n \r\nBoth fursuit lounges are fursuiters-only areas, intended to offer a safe place to quickly cool down, get some refreshments, make repairs, dry their suits and change costumes without ruining the magic. To make the fursuiters' stay in the fursuit lounges as convenient as possible, please respect the following rules:\r\n\r\n- Only fursuiters may enter and stay in the fursuit lounge at any time, in and out of fursuit.\r\n- Non-Suiters are not allowed to enter the headless area.\r\n- The only exception are personal helpers, assisting a fursuiter with their costume. They can only enter the lounge hand-in-hand with the suiter for the time they are assisting, but not on their own.\r\n- Suiters currently not in suit will need to present their personal fursuit badge at the checkpoint to enter the lounge.\r\n- Please refrain from bringing glass cups\/bottles into the lounge, to protect suiters from broken glass.\r\n- Photography and filming is strictly forbidden.\r\n\r\nFursuit Lounge Opening Hours\r\n\r\nMain Lounge: 09:00 - 02:00 or end of dance\r\nMini Lounge: always open\r\n\r\nThe Main Lounge is open every convention day from 09:00 and closes 30 minutes after the last event. Should you need to access the lounge after this, you can contact EF-Security via the hotline and kindly ask them to let you in. The Mini Lounge near the lobby is open around the clock.\r\n\r\nExtra Days!\r\nOn Early Arrival Day, the lounge is open from 18:00 to 02:00 the next morning.\r\nOn Sunday after the convention, the lounge opens at 09:00. At 14:00 breakdown of the lounges begins. Please remove all your fursuit parts from the dryer systems by this time.\r\nFor the Dead Dog Dance, the Main Lounge will operate with reduced equipment.","ConferenceDayId":"8af3f161-2b00-11e6-af7b-066e23d209cf","StartTime":"21:00:00","EndTime":"05:00:00","Duration":"08:00:00","ConferenceRoomId":"8d650ea7-f9b8-45b5-8a1c-7f8c519d362d","PanelHosts":"Mystifur","IsDeviatingFromConBook":"0"},{"Id":"744dfdbb-5c95-420f-8130-fe4022edb876","LastChangeDateTimeUtc":"2016-07-15T15:20:01Z","IsDeleted":"0","SourceEventId":"1033","ImageId":null,"Slug":"drawing_with_ritka","Title":"Drawing with Ritka!

Everything is bright and colorful! ... or is it? This year, one of the major TV networks is going to host an all new gameshow which will get the highest ratings yet! It is all about the ratings, isn't it? Join in as studio audience for our production of THE GAMESHOW!\r\n\r\nAs usual, the competition is between teams of two, so if you are a suiter willing to participate, be sure to pair up and be ready! If you can't find a partner, drop by anyway, we'll keep a list of single participants to mix and match!\r\n\r\n\"How are the teams selected?\", and \"Can I participate?\" - Sure! That's what the preliminaries are for! We have taken your feedback into consideration and split the preliminaries into several smaller games again, yet they will be located close to each other and in public view, in the Rotunda! There are some mini-games to judge dexterity and acting capabilities. Also, you can add bonus points by collecting for charity for ten minutes. Overall you should be done in about 10-15 minutes, without the 10 minute charity run. The results - and thus the players for the stage show - will be on display next to the fursuit lounge entrance at about 19:00 (7pm) give or take.\r\n\r\nIf you participate in the preliminaries, be prepared to be on stage for the main event too! We need eight teams (and a spare one) to go on stage after all! Also, if you are amongst the first ten teams, be sure to be at the stage briefing ON TIME as we need to assign the available game combinations to the teams and explain the games you are going to play! You need to attend both, the briefing and the stage event for the full duration: 14:30-17:30 so please don't sign up if you can't make the time! Stage briefing can be attended without fursuit though.\r\n\r\nEarly Sign up for the preliminaries is on Wednesday, 18:30-19:30. This is also the best opportunity to ask us questions! Regular sign up is on Thursday, 12:00-14:30. Both will be at the main registration desk!\r\n\r\nThe sign in station is also the place to get any questions answered that you still might have: just drop by early and ask us, we don't bite!\r\n\r\nKeep in mind, that you have to run, jump, grab- and throw things in suit. So be aware that even though we try to make these games safe for everyone, your suit has to take some physical action.\r\n\r\nSign up:\r\nEarly: Wednesday, 18:30-19:30, Main registration desk Regular: Thursday, 12:00-14:30, Main registration desk\r\n\r\nPreliminaries:\r\nThursday, 12:30-15:00, Rotunda\r\n\r\nStage Briefing, for the qualified teams:\r\nFriday, 14:30-15:30, Main Stage\r\n\r\nThe Fursuit Gameshow:\r\nFriday, 16:00-17:30, Main Stage","ConferenceDayId":"8af3def1-2b00-11e6-af7b-066e23d209cf","StartTime":"12:30:00","EndTime":"15:00:00","Duration":"02:30:00","ConferenceRoomId":"bfdf526f-62bb-49cb-8980-8639c20c4d90","PanelHosts":"Atkelar","IsDeviatingFromConBook":"0"},{"Id":"ade3cf4e-ef6e-43ed-9ac1-c7a7b5e96311","LastChangeDateTimeUtc":"2016-07-20T19:30:01Z","IsDeleted":"0","SourceEventId":"929","ImageId":null,"Slug":"artist_lounge_fri_1","Title":"Artists' Lounge ","SubTitle":"Let's be creative together!","ConferenceTrackId":"39218c14-2450-4266-8668-cde4d2878669","Abstract":"Do you like spending your evening around other artists, drawing and chatting about techniques, supplies and other themes?

Maybe you've been to the Motorfurs meet at the BAY WATCH all the cars and GOLDEN GIRLS. You might be bouncing all about with the GUMMIBEARS, listen to the cockroaches DUCKTALES, or chat with CHIP & CHAP. You may even have a bad hangover from saying too much CHEERS with MAGNUM-bottles and those FRAGGLES at the Bar.\r\nDon't despair, the Fursuit-Support A-TEAM has got you covered. When you feel lost in the past, we get you BACK TO THE FUTURE. Take the QUANTUM LEAP into one of our well equipped Fursuit Lounges and take your M.A.S.K. off.\r\nAs if MACGYVER and INSPECTOR GADGET designed them, they feature refreshments and mini snacks, cooling blowers and costume drying racks, repair station and coolpack freezer. There's just one thing unfortunate: Having enough spaces on the powered drying rack for all 1000 fursuits will always be a MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. So please be so kind to remove your costume from the the powered dryer as soon as possible, to give another fur the chance to use it. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMain Lounge\r\nThe Main Lounge is located near the Main Stage, close to the dances and events. You can find all our services and plenty of space here. You should also gather here for the parade. This lounge will be locked a night.\r\n\r\nMini Lounge\r\nWith the size of the convention growing as it is, the Main Lounge may occasionally be a struggle to reach, if you are on the other end of the hotel and in need of a cup of water and a safe place. Therefore we now have the Mini Lounge in the Estrel Hall Foyer, near the lobby. (That is the room in front of the ConOps office). A smaller location with viewing protection and fresh water around the clock, for a quick heads-off cool down.\r\n \r\n \r\nBoth fursuit lounges are fursuiters-only areas, intended to offer a safe place to quickly cool down, get some refreshments, make repairs, dry their suits and change costumes without ruining the magic. To make the fursuiters' stay in the fursuit lounges as convenient as possible, please respect the following rules:\r\n\r\n- Only fursuiters may enter and stay in the fursuit lounge at any time, in and out of fursuit.\r\n- Non-Suiters are not allowed to enter the headless area.\r\n- The only exception are personal helpers, assisting a fursuiter with their costume. They can only enter the lounge hand-in-hand with the suiter for the time they are assisting, but not on their own.\r\n- Suiters currently not in suit will need to present their personal fursuit badge at the checkpoint to enter the lounge.\r\n- Please refrain from bringing glass cups\/bottles into the lounge, to protect suiters from broken glass.\r\n- Photography and filming is strictly forbidden.\r\n\r\nFursuit Lounge Opening Hours\r\n\r\nMain Lounge: 09:00 - 02:00 or end of dance\r\nMini Lounge: always open\r\n\r\nThe Main Lounge is open every convention day from 09:00 and closes 30 minutes after the last event. Should you need to access the lounge after this, you can contact EF-Security via the hotline and kindly ask them to let you in. The Mini Lounge near the lobby is open around the clock.\r\n\r\nExtra Days!\r\nOn Early Arrival Day, the lounge is open from 18:00 to 02:00 the next morning.\r\nOn Sunday after the convention, the lounge opens at 09:00. At 14:00 breakdown of the lounges begins. Please remove all your fursuit parts from the dryer systems by this time.\r\nFor the Dead Dog Dance, the Main Lounge will operate with reduced equipment.","ConferenceDayId":"8af3def1-2b00-11e6-af7b-066e23d209cf","StartTime":"09:00:00","EndTime":"15:00:00","Duration":"06:00:00","ConferenceRoomId":"8d650ea7-f9b8-45b5-8a1c-7f8c519d362d","PanelHosts":"Mystifur","IsDeviatingFromConBook":"0"},{"Id":"fae1b5b6-24b0-44f2-a445-91c33399d34c","LastChangeDateTimeUtc":"2016-07-15T14:10:02Z","IsDeleted":"0","SourceEventId":"948","ImageId":null,"Slug":"dealers_den_artist_setup_fri","Title":"Dealers' Den ","SubTitle":"Artist Setup","ConferenceTrackId":"9f1f1e8a-6ae7-46fb-8db1-4bb4fc1d2400","Abstract":"In the Dealers' Den artists and dealers from all over the world sell all kind of furry related art, prints, sketches, books, comics, t-shirts and all different kind of merchandise.
